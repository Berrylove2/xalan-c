      <li>Porting of conf utility to the UNIX platform. 
          The conf utility is a test harness designed to run the conformance tests located under

          report is generated in HTML format for easy viewing.  For more information on how to use 
          this tool, please see <link idref="commandline" anchor="confexe">"Using the 
          command line utility"</link>.</li>

     <p>We strongly encourage you write patches for problems you find and submit them to
      xalan-dev@xml.apache.org. We review the patches we receive to make sure they do not break something else, and (assuming they 
     do not) include them in our next release. In the interest of fixing bugs, adding enhancements, and addressing outstanding design
     issues, we sincerely want (and need!) your active participation in the ongoing development of Xalan.</p>
