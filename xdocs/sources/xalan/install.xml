<s2 title="Install Source Packages">

The Xalan-C sources may be downloaded from the
<jump href="https://github.com/apache/xalan-c/releases">GitHub releases page</jump>.

<p>When building the Xalan-C library and sample programs, 
you also need the necessary C/C++ compiler tools installed. 
A working copy of the Xerces-C XML parser library must be available 
before you can build the Xalan-C library. 
You may build the Xerces-C XML parser library from a source distribution 
or use a compatible Xerces-C binary distribution.</p>

<p>Building the User Guide web pages from sources requires a 
working Xalan command line program.  The Xalan command-line program must support 
top-level parameters as strings.</p>

<p>Building the interactive API Reference pages requires a UNIX or Linux 
system with a current copy of Doxygen and GraphViz software installed.</p>

Binary packages are not provided directly.  Please use the package manager
provided for your platform.

<s2 title="Install Documentation Packages">

<p>There are actually two distributed documentation packages.  
One contains the website pages and full interactive apiDoc images (355+ megabytes).  
The other contains the website pages and the apiDoc descriptions (47 megabytes) 
without the apiDoc images.  
Except for the absence of interactive apiDoc images, 
the documentation packages are identical.</p>

<p>The documentation packages are distributed as <em>tar</em> and <em>zip</em> files. 
You just extract the contents into a directory that is reachable by your favorite web browser. 
The documentation tree starts with the <em>./xalan-c/</em> directory. 
The top documentation page is the <em>./xalan-c/index.html</em> file.</p>

<p>The documentation is initially a snapshot of the 
<jump href="http://xalan.apache.org/xalan-c/index.html">Apache Xalan-C/C++ website</jump> 
at the time the product was released.</p>
