   <s3 title="Bug reporting">
     <p>All known &xslt4c; bugs are listed in <resource-ref idref="jira"/>. For a list of open bugs with links to each bug
      report, see <resource-ref idref="buglist"/>. If you find a new bug, please enter a XalanC bug report in this
      database.</p>
     <note>Before you can enter your first bug report, you must submit your email address to Jira and receive a password.</note> 
     <p>We strongly encourage you write patches for problems you find and submit them to
      xalan-dev@xml.apache.org. We review the patches we receive to make sure they do not break something else, and (assuming they 
     do not) include them in our next release. In the interest of fixing bugs, adding enhancements, and addressing outstanding design
     issues, we sincerely want (and need!) your active participation in the ongoing development of Xalan.</p>

   <s3 title="What you need from the distributions">
   <p>To rebuild &xslt4c;, you need the &xslt4c; source files, the &xml4c; header files, and
   for Windows the &xml4c; .lib file. If you want to rebuild with the ICU, you will need to download the ICU source package to build the ICU libraries. </p>

<note>You can also download &xslt4c; source distributions from <resource-ref idref="xslt4c-distdir"/>: &xslt4c-dist;-src.zip and &xslt4c-dist;-src.tar.gz. &xml4c; source distributions are available from <resource-ref idref="xml4c-distdir"/>: 
&xml4c-dist;-src.zip and &xml4c-dist;-src.tar.gz.</note>
<p>Keep in mind that at any given point in time the &xslt4c; and &xml4c; source trees in the Apache XML repository may not be consistent. When we release a version of &xslt4c; we certify that it is compatible with a given version of &xml4c;. To be safe, use the Xerces distributions that we certify as compatible. Reminder: &xslt4c-current; is compatible with &xml4c-used;.</p>
   <p>For information on using the <resource-ref idref="icu"/>, see
   <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>.
   The recommended version of ICU for &xslt4c-current; is &icu-current;. You may be able to use newer ICU releases as they appear.</p>
