<s3 title="What you need from the distributions">
<p>To rebuild &xslt4c;, you need the &xslt4c; source files, the &xml4c; header files, and for Windows the &xml4c; .lib file. 
   If you want to rebuild with the ICU, you will need to download the ICU source package to build the ICU libraries. </p>
<note>You can also download &xslt4c; source distributions from <resource-ref idref="xslt4c-distdir"/>: &xslt4c-dist;-src.zip 
      and &xslt4c-dist;-src.tar.gz. &xml4c; source distributions are available from <resource-ref idref="xml4c-distdir"/>: 
      &xml4c-dist;-src.zip and &xml4c-dist;-src.tar.gz.</note>
<p>Keep in mind that at any given point in time the &xslt4c; and &xml4c; source trees in the Apache XML repository may not 
   be consistent. When we release a version of &xslt4c; we certify that it is compatible with a given version of &xml4c;. To 
   be safe, use the Xerces distributions that we certify as compatible. Reminder: &xslt4c-current; is compatible with 
   &xml4c-used;.</p>
<p>For information on using the <resource-ref idref="icu"/>, see <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>.
   The recommended version of ICU for &xslt4c-current; is &icu-current;. You may be able to use newer ICU releases as they appear.</p>

<anchor name="win32"/>
<s3 title="Steps for doing a Windows build">
<p>To build &xslt4c; on Windows, you need &xml4c; and a C++ compiler for Windows (Visual Studio is recommended).</p>
