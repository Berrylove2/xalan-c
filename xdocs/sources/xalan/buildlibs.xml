<br/>
<p>The Xalan-C/C++ XSLT library is built upon the Xerces-C/C++ XML Parser library. 
   Before compiling the Xalan-C/C++ XSLT library, you must have a usable Xerces-C/C++ library.
</p>
<p>You can either install a compatible binary distribution of Xerces-C/C++ or 
   build your own from a source distribution of Xerces-C/C++.
</p>
<p>You can get more information on the Xerces-C/C++ distributions at the 
   <jump href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c">http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c</jump> web site.
